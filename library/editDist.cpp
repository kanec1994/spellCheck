/**
 *
 * Algorithm idea:
 * -> Return the edit distance between two strings
 *
 * A single edit is defined as:
 * -> inserting a character
 * -> removing a character
 * -> substituting a character
 * Each edit has a cost of 1
 *
 * For any two given strings, we return the minimum number edits needed
 * to make the strings equivalent.
 *
 * Consider str1 and str2
 * let xi be the ith position in str1
 * let yj be the jth position in str2
 * Observations:
 * -> if str1 is empty, then we need to insert all of the characters from str2
 * -> if str2 is empty, then we need to insert all of the characters from str1
 * -> deleting a character from one string is the same as inserting it on the other
 *
 *
 * recurrence relationship:
 *              _
 *             | 
 *             | 0                                              if i = 0 and j = 0
 *             | j                                              if i = 0 and j != 0
 *   D[i,j] =  | i                                              if j = 0 and i != 0
 *             | min {D[i-1][j]+1, 
 *             |     D[i][j-1] +1, D[i-1][j-1] + replaceCost}   otherwise
 *             |_

 *
 * time complexity: O(n^2)
